			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to my portfolio page! This website will serve as a repository for everything Iâ€™ve learnt and/or made during this course.<br />
				The main content of this website will be split into two categories: <span class="deliv">&#160;DELIVERABLES&#160;</span> and the <span class="dump">&#160;DUMP&#160;</span>.

				<li><span class="date">&#160;23/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="deliv">&#160;DELIVERABLE&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="#">Comic: Bike Light 2.0</a><br />
				This deliverable is a more detailed version of the comic we made during the first seminar, about the 'Bike Light 2.0', starring the world-renowned professional hipster Hadrian Ipster.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;20/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="dump">&#160;DUMP&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="dump/wc3.pdf">Seminar 3: Ikea Assignment</a><br />
				During this seminar we've attempted to improve the IKEA website in terms of usability. Taking visually impaired people as our target user-group, we've used both existing technology as well as our own creativity 
				to come to a possible solution.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;19/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="dump">&#160;DUMP&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="#">Seminar 2: Application of Subject Matter</a><br/>
				In this seminar we've applied our recently acquired knowledge about interaction design to a series of mini-assignments, once of which was user-testing our 'competitors' - something that proved to be rather troublesome in the case of our
				'Bike Light 2.0'.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;18/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="dump">&#160;DUMP&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="g14.html">Group 14: Coffee Dispensers at Science Park</a><br />
				For our first unsupervised group assignment we've decided to take a closer look at the rather dated coffee dispensers here at Science Park. My role in this assignment was that of interaction design.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;17/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="dump">&#160;DUMP&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="wc1.html">Seminar 1: Bike Light 2.0</a><br />
				In this seminar we analysed and further elaborated upon a single mini-assignment, in this case the 'Bike Light 2.0', by drawing comics, wireframes and filling out personas.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;16/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="deliv">&#160;DELIVERABLE&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="visibility.html">MIT 3: Visibility</a><br />
				Draughts is a massively popular and fairly simple boardgame played by many all across the globe. The physical version of this game is very easy to learn and use, and as such I have done my best to design a simple, lightweight user interface that
				shares these qualities.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;16/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="deliv">&#160;DELIVERABLE&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="learnability.html">MIT 2: Learnability</a><br />
				In this assignment I take a closer look at the learnability of a classical termostat, one that's often used incorrectly.</li><br />
				<li><span class="date">&#160;16/2/14&#160;</span>&#160;&#160;<span class="deliv">&#160;DELIVERABLE&#160;</span>&#160;<a href="usability.html">MIT 1: Usability</a><br />
				In this MIT assignment I take a closer look at the usability of a combination padlock, divided into five sub-qualities: learnability, memorability, efficiency, errors and satisfaction.</li>
